Hide those pesky annoying plugin notifications and inline warnings at the top of all admin pages.

== Description ==

If plugin notifications and inline warnings are getting in your way, activate the WP Nag Hide Plugin and it will give you the option to hide the update notifications and plugin warnings in your admin panel. It ONLY hides the notices at the top of the admin pages, it does NOT hide the notices under a plugin on the plugins page.


Some notifications of course can be closed or dismissed for a period of time manually, and some can be useful to know. The WP Nag Hide plugin gives you the power to globally hide notifications or just individual plugins that are causing the nags!

A simple, lightweight plugin that even works on WP multisites.
