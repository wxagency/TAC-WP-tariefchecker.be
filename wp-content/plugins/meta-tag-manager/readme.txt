== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= OK, I've installed the plugin, how and where do I start adding meta tags? =

You can manage your meta tags in two areas of your WordPress dashboard.

* Within Settings > Meta Tag Manager.

*The general settings page is where you can add tags that appear on various areas of your site, such as your front page, archive pages, category/taxonomy pages, etc. Each tag you create can be assigned to a specific are of the site.*

* On specific post type pages.

*When editing a post, page, or other CPT (such as an event, product, etc.) you can add meta tags that will only be displayed on that item's page. The Meta Tag Manager will be available as an individual meta box.*

= I don't see the Meta Tag Manager meta box when editing a page on my site =

This may be because your editing a CPT and it's not selected within our settings page for Meta Tag Management. See next question for more information.

= How do I enable/disable Meta Tag Manager for specific Custom Post Types (CPTs)? =

By default (since 2.1) all custom post types are enabled, previous versions only had posts/pages enabled. If you install a plugin that introduces a new CPT, that also needs to be added, as it is not added automatically.

You can add or remove this via Settings > Meta Tag Manager > General Options (tab). You'll see an input box containing a list of already enabled CPTs and you can click the input box to show and select other available CPTs to include, or click the X next to the CPT you wish to remove.

= I'm stuck, or have a suggestion. =

Please visit our <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/meta-tag-manager">support forums</a> if you have any questions.

== Screenshots ==

1. Once the plugin is activated you can add/edit/delete tags from the menu in *Settings > Meta Tag Manager*

2. You can also choose what post types to manage specific meta tags

3. If enabled you can add meta tags to a specific post in it's own meta box
