If the backup does not proceed within 15 seconds then something is interfering with the WordPress CRON system such as: server loopback issues, caching plugins, scheduling plugins, another plugin using all available cron time, or another BackupBuddy process in progress (file transfers, other backups, Stash Live backup) taking up all cron time. Try disabling other plugins to see if it resolves issue.  Check the Server Information page cron section to see if the next BackupBuddy step is scheduled to run. Enable \"Classic\" backup mode on the \"Settings\" page to rule out non-cron issues. Additionally you may verify no other backup processes are trying to run at the same time by verifying there is not an existing backup process listed in the cron hogging the cron process."}
